# List the things you added for points

To get a full 20 points, expand upon the game in the following ways 
    [+2] Include more than eight passages. DONE!
    [+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item. INCREMENTED WITH THE PILL SYSTEM AS IT ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE MORE AND GET THE OVERDOSE ENDING

    [+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa). AT THE BEGINNING YOU DO A SURVEY THAT ASKS HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. IF YOU CHOOSE PANIC YOU GET A DIFFERENT ENDING.

    [+1] Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested). IMPLEMENTED AFTER YOU SEE THE FIGURE BEHIND YOU AND GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM. YOU GET A DESCRIPTION DIFFERENT FROM THE INITIAL ONE.
